Hey GameMakers! <br/><br/>Welcome to the third "Sunday School" sermon. <br/><br/>This time I decided to tackle a very common problem: dealing damage to objects. Specifically in this case using melee attacks. I cover different ways to check for collisions, how to prevent targets from being hit multiple times, and to actually communicate dealt damage in a more sophisticated way.

Thanks for reading and / or watching!

Now go make something awesome!
