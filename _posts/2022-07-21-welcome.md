Hey GameMakers! <br/><br/>Welcome to my new blog! <br/><br/>So what can you expect to find on this site moving forward? Ideally: tutorials. 

Written tutorials are so much easier to create and maintain than video tutorials. I could spend a week preparing, writing, recording, editing a tutorial. Then I post it and immediately find something wrong with it. Or weeks or months down the line the tutorial is completely invalidated by a new update from Yoyo. Or a viewer could have a question about something, and instead of being able to update the video to clarify for everyone else who comes after them, I can only respond to the comment and hope others will see it before asking a question... if they even bother to ask at all.

A text tutorial fixes all that. And while it won't be as discoverable to newer devs who are often on Youtube looking for guidance, hopefully it will reach enough of the desired audience to be useful.

Thanks for reading! And I hope you'll find something helpful or inspiring on this new blog in the near future!

Now go make something awesome!
