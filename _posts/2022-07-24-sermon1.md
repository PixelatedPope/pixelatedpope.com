Hey GameMakers! <br/><br/>Welcome to my first "Sunday School" sermon... thing... <br/><br/>What is that? Basically I pick a topic, hit record, and talk for as long as I feel I need to to cover the topic well. Check it out here!

**Note:** I don't mention Tile Collisions in this video. Maybe they deserve their own post or video.

"Wait. Is that video an hour and fifteen Earth minutes long?!"

Yes. Yes it is. 

It's a lecture. Not a tutorial. It's recorded in a single take with zero editing. Will this be useful to people? Who knows. But it's a very easy thing for me to produce and release. If even just a few people get something out of it, then it was worth it.

Feel free to watch it at 2x speed or don't watch it at all!


Thanks for reading!

Now go make something awesome!
