My name is Jonathan Peterson. I've been using GameMaker since 2009 starting with GM7. 

Rather than actually building games, I found it more fun to help others build their games. I accomplished this by creating written tutorials on Reddit, video tutorials on Youtube, releasing useful tools and systems on the Yoyo Marketplace and Itch.io, and helping people live through Discord.

With the launch of this website I hope to have a central location to find all of the GameMaker content I produce!  Thanks for being here ðŸ˜Ž
